# Third-party notices: `dev.supermux.editor:editor-syntax`

editor-syntax itself is MIT licensed, like the rest of this repository. Its native libraries additionally
**contain compiled third-party code**: the tree-sitter runtime, every grammar listed below (its generated
parser and external scanner; for bundled grammars also its parse tables, compressed), and, in the Linux and
Windows libraries only, zlib. This file lists what is inside the libraries built from the pinned sources
(`native/upstream.lock.json`, `native/grammars.lock.json`) and reproduces the required notices.

Which artifacts: every `libsupermux_syntax*.{so,dylib,dll,a}` that `native/build.sh` produces, the Android
`jni/<abi>/libsupermux_syntax_jni.so`, and the JVM jar's `dev/supermux/editor/syntax/natives/<target>/` resources.

Also linked, from the toolchain: LLVM libc++ (Apache-2.0 with LLVM exceptions) statically into the Android,
Linux and Windows libraries, for tree-sitter-vue's C++ scanner; zig's mingw-w64 CRT startup objects and
winpthreads into the Windows DLL. **Build-time only, not linked:** the JDK's `jni.h` and the vendored `native/jni/*/jni_md.h`
(GPLv2 with the Classpath exception), the Android NDK, zig, and tree-sitter-cli (used to regenerate clojure).

 #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its

 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear

 #
 #  NO WARRANTY
 #
 #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

 #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
 #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,

 #  any right of any third party.
 #
 #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
 #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
 #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
 #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
 #
 #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other

 #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,

 #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
 #  production of secondary products from the program.
 #
 #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
 #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
 #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
 #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in

5. Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.

 # 7.  Database Ownership
 #
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

## mingw-w64 winpthreads and runtime (Windows DLL only)

`zig cc -target x86_64-windows-gnu` links winpthreads statically (the DLL's pthread mutexes; it imports no winpthread DLL) and the mingw-w64 CRT startup code. The texts are from zig 0.16.0's bundled mingw-w64: the header of `libc/mingw/winpthreads/mutex.c` (winpthreads ships no COPYING there) and `libc/mingw/COPYING`.
